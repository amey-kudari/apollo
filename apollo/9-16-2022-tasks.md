# useQuery
## Variables to check: loading, data, networkStatus

## For below scenarios:
### mount
- loading, error, data, network status at render: 1 :  true undefined undefined 1
- on data load: loading, error, data, network status at render: 2 :  false undefined {comments: Array(1)} 7
### change in variables in useQuery itself
- loading, error, data, network status at render: 4 :  true undefined undefined 2
- loading, error, data, network status at render: 6 :  false undefined {comments: Array(0)} 7

### refetch call without variables
- No change, loads from cache
### refetch call with variables (different from previous query)
- loading, error, data, network status at render: 8 :  false undefined {comments: Array(1)} 7

polling call
- nextFetchPolicy
fetchMore call
- nextFetchPolicy
### when fetchPolicy is used and when nextFetchPolicy.
done!
### when refetching -> does nextFetchPolicy apply?
- yes
### when refetching with diff variables -> does nextFetchPolicy apply?
- yes
# try the same for fetch/ poll /  change in query variables
done!
# useLazyQuery
- firstFetchPolicy works every time, refetch is always second fetch policy
# Do we get network status for this?
- yes
# If so which values are possible?
- All
# useMutation
Try reset method and check { data, loading, error, called }
### what is the meaning of notifyOnNetworkStatusChange for useMutation?
- rerender on change of data or error or loading
